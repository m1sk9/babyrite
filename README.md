  app:
    image: ghcr.io/m1sk9/babyrite:v0.14.0

      - .env

If you are using orchestration tools such as k8s or Docker Swarm, please configure them according to their respective configuration files.

## Configuration and Environment Variables

You can customize the behavior of babyrite by using a dedicated configuration file. The settings are written in TOML format. Refer to [`config/config.toml`](./config/config.toml) for configuration items.

```toml
feature_flag = ""
is_mention = true
