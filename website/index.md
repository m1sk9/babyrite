features:
  - title: ✨️ Easy
    details: Docker Image allows you to run in any environment, and can be easily hosted with Docker Compose or k8s.
  - title: 🏎️ Fast
    details: Fast because you don't need to query the Discord API to get the channel list. It also uses less memory, which saves resources.
  - title: 🎈 Lightweight
    details: Because it is compiled as a binary in Rust, it is very lightweight because it does not need unnecessary runtime, unlike discord.js or JDA written in Bot.
