# Usage

## Quoting a Message

When you send a message link to a channel, babyrite will fetch and display the message.

babyrite can quote the following messages:

- Messages from channels that babyrite has access to
- Messages from channels with NSFW settings turned off
- Messages that contain embeds

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> To prevent spamming, babyrite will quote only the first message link.

## Skipping a Message Quote

By default, babyrite will quote all messages. If there is a message you don't want to be quoted, enclose the link in `<>`.
