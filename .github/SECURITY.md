# Security Policy

A Guide to babyrite's Security Policy.

## Supported Versions

Since babyrite is currently in beta, only minor updates of the latest version are supported. Vulnerabilities are fixed only in minor updates and **not backported to older versions**.

Also, because of the possibility of destructive changes without prior notice, updates may change the behavior of the software and may cause incompatibility. Always check the patch notes.

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you find a serious security vulnerability in babyrite, you must follow the proper procedures to report it. **DO NOT** report in Issues.

The reporting procedure is as follows.

1. Go to [Security Advisories](https://github.com/m1sk9/babyrite/security/advisories).
2. Click on **New draft security advisory**.
3. Fill in **Advisory Details**.
    - See the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory#creating-a-security-advisory) for more information on what to enter.
4. Click on **Create draft security advisory**.

The advisory will be reviewed by the maintainer and released to the public.

> [!WARNING]  
> **DO NOT PUBLISH EXTERNALLY** until full disclosure of the reported advisory has been made.
